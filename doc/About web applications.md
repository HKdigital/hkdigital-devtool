# About web applications

## Structure

A web application typically exists of a `backend` and a `frontend` part. A web application may have multiple frontends. E.g. a frontend for a backoffice and a frontend for customers.

### The `frontend` part
The frontend is the part of the application that users view and interact with. A web frontend is a frontend that runs in a webbrowser.

### The `backend` part
The backend is the part of the application that may store the application's files, data in a database and may contains business logic of functionality that can better be done on a server. In contrast with somple websites, most web applications need a backend. The backend does not always need to be a custom backend. A generic cloud based backend is also an option.
